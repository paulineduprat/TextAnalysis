    "Previous studies into regional linguistics have generally focused on one of three themes. First, they focus on studying specific, often colloquial, phrases. An example of this study would be Joshua Katz' book \"Speaking American\" where the titular image of this notebook was found. This research would analyze how different regions referred to the same objects or ideas. It would often focus on slang and would not delve at all into every day language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another genre of study would be the close examination of one or two dialects. Kaitlyn Lee did such a study in her \"Analysis of Regional Linguistic Variation\" where she closely examined two neighboring towns that lay across state lines. These studies are often conducted using survey methods and have a very specific scope and focus. Such study attempts to establish patterns of speech across a very small geospatial divide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, considerable study has been done into phonetics, pronunciations, and accents. These studies are sound-based and care little about the actual vocabulary used."

    "Our study differs from the rest in a few ways, and most of these differences are based in our computational methods. First, it does not focus on specific phrases or words. It does not look to establish synonyms found across cultures. Rather, we wish to have a more holistic view of a regions vernacular. Having a data driven approach means that we will not be providing our algorithims with specific words or phrases to look at; rather we will be guiding models so that they can tell *us* about the vocabulary of different regions. In this way it is different from studies like Katz' and Lee's. Our methods will construct a linguistic identity through the study of text, rather than using establish textual patterns to analyze a linguistic identity. Furthermore, using computational methods allows us to study cities thousands of miles apart from eachother. It will also allow us to possibly establish a gradient of language, whereas previous survey models would be too discrete to establish such trends. Finally, our study is focused entirely on text, and thus questions of pronunciations or speech are not involved."

    "In this notebook we will be looking at data taken from the 2017 Yelp Academic Dataset. The dataset is made publically available in the form of 6 JSON files. For our corpus, we converted two of these files (businesses and reviews) to csv files, and extracted only the required information for our analyses to better manipulate the data. Our corpus contains roughly 4 million reviews written by 1 million users about 144 thousand businesses. We decided to use the raw text of these reviews in combination with the location of businesses and when the review was written. In this notebook we will be exploring the linguistic differences between cities in relation to when the reviews are posted. One important feature of our corpus is that the data is not distributed uniformly meaning that there are a limited amount of reviews for some cities and many reviews for other cities. Although the data does not represent the entirety of the U.S., the data does give us a full range of latitudes stretching from the south of the U.S. up through Canada.More specifically, our corpus had a good amount of data for cities in the southwest, midwest, and the southeastern part of Canada. Therefore, we decided to focus on these areas and look for differences in the overall experiences of reviewers as well as their sentiments towards local businesses. In an effort to narrow our focus, we limited our data to reviews written in 2014, 2015, and 2016."

    "We see a clear latitudinal trend in this graph. Southern cities are clustered at the top while northern cities are at the bottom. In fact, it appears that the linguistic similarity of two cities is directly proportional to the geographic distance between them. Starting with one city and ranking its similarity to the rest is essentially indistinguishable from ranking by lattitude. This was supported by a dendrogram analysis; clustering by physical distances produces almost the exact same results as clustering by language.\n",

    "Different regions use distinct language to describe their satisfaction. This manifests as vocabulary, e.g. the Midwest heavily uses terrific and delightful while other regions don't. Distinct language also seems to reveal patterns of satisfaction. We see a Canadian tendency to enjoy the unique and undiscovered. Midwesterners love their desserts. Southwesterners care deeply about service and experience. Notice how congruent these results are with our original analysis where we found that the Midwest focused on taste and the Southwest on service.\n",

    "There are some important notes to keep in mind. First, the reviews were aggregated by region, rather than city. This method can be very easily adapted to instead compare individual cities rather than groups. This approach would not be ideal for answering our specific question (since we observed linguistic grouping of regions), but would be helpful for other questions that wanted to more deeply explore a city's linguistic identity. Furthermore, while a random sample avoids bias in the method, there is inherent bias in the make up of our data. In other words, different cities and regions have different frequencies of types of businesses. Cities with more of one type of restaurant or business will show distinct words bent towards those genres. This is somewhat balanced out by the fact that a higher frequency of certain types of business is also a part of the city's identity. Nonetheless, access to a larger corpus would allow us to re-conduct this study and control for specific genres of businesses."

    "    Overall, these results were not so fruitful in the sense that the words did not give us clear differences in seasons or indication that cities experience seasons differently when it comes to their reviews of local businesses. However, some words show what we would expect from the simulation. For example, the word \"doctor\" shows up in Toronto's winter reviews which may indicate an increase of doctor visits due to lower temperatures. We also noticed that seafood was exclusively mentioned in the Spring and Summer reviews accross all citites potentially indicating that most types of seafood can be caught or farmed locally during these months (which from what I researched seems to be true). Another observation was that in Phoenix, the common beverages were \"beergaritas\", coffee, and whiskey. In Pittsburgh  people drank juice, wine, beer, and coke. In Toronto, people seem to be drinking mainly beer and monsters (potentially refering to the kind of soda?). We also found it interesting that \"Portugeese\" shows up in Toronto's Spring reviews, \"italian\" in the Winder reviews, and \"taiwan\" in the Fall reviews. \n",
    "    After doing this analysis, we wanted to look deeper into customer experience. This brings us to our next analysis which looks more specidically at positive and negative sentiment analysis. We will look specifically at temperature differences and seasonal differences of specific cities in the midwest, the southwest, and canada. "

    "### Hypothesis 1: Different regions use different vocabulary to speak about satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using machine learning to produce regionally distinctive words supported this hypothesis. We found that closer regions shared more distinct words. We also saw that while there was overlap in the words used to describe satisfaction, each region used certain adjectives at such higher levels that those words became uniquely distinct for their respective region. This is exactly the kind of results we hypothesized: certain seemingly ordinary words are uniquely common to particular regions. Aggregating these words can produce a vocabulary or identity for regions and cities. Culturally this means we should expand our understanding of dialects beyond simple slang or idiosyncracies. Midwest language is defined by much more than their use of the word pop, or the way they pronounce \"been\". Beyond that, they have a fundamentally different frequency use of the English language. Even with a sample as large as ours we see a bias of that region towards simple words like \"terrific\", whereas other regions show similar bias towards other seemingly innocuous adjectives. Why exactly these regions choose such adjectives is impossible to say from this analysis, and likely will find its answer in a non-computational approach. "

    "Next, we saw that certain regions favored particular words that could be grouped into linguistic gestalts. The Midwest talked considerably more about taste, specifically desserts, while the Southwest cared more about service and experience. Canada stood in the middle ground but showed a strong tendency to enjoy hidden or unique venues. These results went beyond our hypothesis. It appears possible that cities not only use different words to describe satisfaction, but also weight factors differently when determining their level of satisfaction. Determining these weightings is an empirical way of constructing a city's cultural identity. It should be noted that these results could have been arrived at in two ways. The first is our method, using a data driven approach to determine what cultural themes are present in the language. The second would be a more social-science, hand driven approach where the cultural themes were first identified in the population, and that data would be used to guess at the language that would appear. Our method has allowed us to establish these trends without imposing the bias of a hand-driven approach. We arrived at these cultural themes from nothing more than text and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of our study has shown that the language of a region, and especially its language of satisfaction, is influenced by at least two major factors. First, different regions have vocabulary differences that stretch beyond slang and into the very fabric of the words they choose. Second, language is heavily driven by cultural preferences, and these cultural preferences can be distilled from a data-driven analysis of distinct language. This knowledge can be utilized to either continue to analyze differences in language, or it can be used as a jumping off point to identify cultural trends and tendencies in different cities and regions.

    "    \n",
    "When we looked at sentiment analysis by season, one takeaway is that the bar graphs for positive word proportions shows a greater variance between seasons than the negative word proportions chart. This may be due to the fact that individuals voice their satisfaction more than their negative experiences. Though these outputs are somewhat different than what we expected (northern cities to have higher negative and lower positive words than southern cities), the data shows that cities in close proximity to one another have similar positive/negative trends when it comes to sentiment accross seasons. This brings us to our final graphs where we try to uncover how temperature affects our sentiment analysis results among different cities by looking at each specific day's temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After establishing a clear correlation between latitude and positive sentiment, we hypothesized that temperature affected positive language. Since temperature varied from city to city, this would explain some of the regional differences in language. We found strong evidence supporting this claim. The higher the latitude in the United States, the more cold temperature becomes a factor. Similarly, we found that northern cities (Madison and Toronto) showed a stronger relationship between temperature and positivity than did mid-line cities (Charlotte) while southern cities (Phoenix) showed absolutely no linear correlation. This leads us to conclude that cold weather affects positive sentiment in language, and since cold weather affects cities differently, this drives some of the linguistic difference we originally found. Thus, temperature should be interpreted as a confounding variable. Some of the linguistic distance that we discovered can be explained by the varying presence of cold temperatures, rather than any inherent cultural truths.  \n"

    "The division of labor in our project was pretty easygoing. We both did a lot of preliminary data analysis to better understand our massive corpus and what we wanted to focus on for the sake of this project. We agreed on narrowing it down to looking specifically at location, lingistic differences, and seasonal differences to focus our project on one specific questions: What drives the differences in Yelp reviews among cities. While Landon did some statistical data analysis with geospacial location data using R to try to better understand linguistic differences in our chosen cities, Pauline used python to explore the differences in seasonal variation of positive and negative sentiment. We both created data visualizations to demonstate what we found in our separate analyses. After meeting a couple times to refine our topic and coordinate our analyses, we each wrote up parts of the final Report.\n",
