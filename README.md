# Text Analysis for Digital Humanists and Social Scientists

Increasingly, humanityâ€™s cultural material is being captured and stored in the form of electronic text. From historical documents, literature and poems, diaries, political speeches, and government documents, to emails, text messages, and social media, students from the humanities and social sciences now have access to immense amounts of rich, and diverse, text. This course introduces students to cutting edge ways of structuring, analyzing, and interpreting digitized text-as-data. We will explore questions fundamental to the humanities and social science and provide the skills necessary to perform end to end research projects. We will use the open source programming language, Python, and  provide demonstration corpora relevant to both the humanities and social sciences.
